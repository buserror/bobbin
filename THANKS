Kalus Dormann (Klaus2m5 on Github), for writing the exhaustive 6502 test
battery that was critically important to verify bobbin's functionality

Adam Barnes (amb5l on GitHub), for porting Dormann's test battery to the
ca65 assembler.

Bruce Clark, for writing the BCD-specific 6502 tests.

Alain Mosnier <alain@wanamoon.net>, for creating the sha-256 module that
bobbin uses to verify ROM checksums, and releasing it to the
public domain.

James Hall, who helped early on with testing and feedback

Steven Hugg (sehugg on Github), author, and creator of 8bitworkshop.com,
an excelent in-browser IDE for a staggeringly large variety of 8-bit
computers and video game consoles. One of 8bitworkshop.com's most
notable features is that it compiles and emulates your code *as you
type*, so that as you make changes in your code, the changes appear
almost instantaneously in the accompanying emulator window.
.
This dramatically shrank my development cycle, from
"code -> compile -> make a disk image -> fire up an emulator -> load the
disk image -> test -> debug", to simply "code -> debug", and
revolutionized my programming productivity.
.
This "bobbin" project was directly inspired by that rapid dev cycle, as
I wanted to return to using a Unix terminal, with my favorite editor
(vim) and a full-featured git implementation, while still being able to
have an emulator that can constantly refresh itself in response to
updated build results (this is provided by bobbin's --watch option),
though I must also separately set up a build environment that watches
changes in the source files (that part is outside bobbin's scope: I use
the Linux tool "inotifywait" to accomplish it).
